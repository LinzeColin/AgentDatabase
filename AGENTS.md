# AgentDatabase Agent Contract

## P0 repository boundary

This checkout is the sole canonical `LinzeColin/AgentDatabase` repository.
Its active product scopes are `OpenAIDatabase/` and top-level `MemoryAtlas/`.
Do not restore projects migrated to other repositories, the retired root
governance tree, a second OpenAIDatabase fact source, private core, credentials,
session material, `data/raw_archives/**`, or historical large archives.

The canonical branch is `main`. Use ordinary commits and fast-forward-safe
pushes only after the active task gates pass. Do not create a temporary remote
branch or pull request, and never reset, rebase, merge, force-push, or rewrite
history as a migration shortcut.

## OpenAIDatabase routing

Read `OpenAIDatabase/AGENTS.md` before changing OpenAIDatabase. Start task
routing with:

```bash
python3 -B OpenAIDatabase/scripts/route_agent_resources.py \
  --database-dir OpenAIDatabase --intent startup
```

The generated memory discovery object is
`OpenAIDatabase/data/memory/agent-memory.json`. Follow its indexed paths only
when task-relevant; do not recursively scan raw or private data.

## Migration recovery

The S04-S13 preservation package under
`OpenAIDatabase/docs/migration_handoff/20260717_local_s04_s13_preservation/`
is evidence, not an integrated tree. Reconcile patches in order, preserve the
post-split architecture, and require material coverage loss to be zero before
starting S14. Rebuild generated views from current canonical facts; do not copy
old generated views.

One meaningful run may complete at most one product Phase. Unknown remote,
App, live, authorization, readiness, or data-freshness facts remain UNKNOWN or
FAILED until directly reverified.
