# AgentDatabase

Archived Codex agent history, migrated off this Mac to keep local storage clean.
**Private repository** — these archives contain full agent session transcripts and
may include API keys, tokens, file paths, and private conversation content.
Do not make this repository public.

## Contents

Large archives are stored as **release assets** (not in git), because GitHub
rejects any file over 100 MB inside a repository. See the release
[`old-mac-20260630`](../../releases/tag/old-mac-20260630).

| Asset | Size | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `codex-token-history-migration-pack-20260630.tar.gz` | 1.08 GiB | Token-usage history migration pack from the old Mac: 408 session rollouts (2026-06-02 → 2026-06-30), sqlite log databases, `~/.codex` home state |
| `old-mac-session-history-20260630.tar.gz` | 800 MiB | Old-Mac Codex session history export |
| `current-mac-session-history-20260630.tar.gz` | 36.5 MiB | Current-Mac Codex session history export, as of 2026-06-30 |
| `codex-numeric-token-usage-export-20260630.tar.gz` | 147 KiB | Numeric token-usage export (CSV/JSON) |

The 408 session rollouts in the migration pack exist **only** here — they were never
imported into `~/.codex/sessions` on this machine.
